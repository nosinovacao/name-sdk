# NAME: Self-Contained Dependencies Management
[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nosinovacao/name-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nosinovacao/name-sdk)
[![AppVeyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/p6iokqd596iuw3vr/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nosinovacao/name-sdk/branch/master)


NAME is a service dependencies management library designed to expose and access services information, written in C#. 

Its goal is to make it easier and simpler to detect service dependencies problems in a world where there are more and more services per application. It provides human and machine friendly dependencies information without the need for external tools.

### Main Features
* Self-contained
* Developer friendly service dependencies definition
* Human and machine readable service dependencies status
* Deep dependencies health checks
* Third-party service dependencies checks
* Support for **optional** central registration
* .Net Core and .NET 4.5+ compatible

## Getting Started 
### Installing on ASP.NET Web API
1. Install the Nuget Package
```powershell
    Install-Package NAME.WebApi
```

The configuration file is present in `App_Start/NAMEConfig.cs` and the dependencies definition file is `dependencies.json`.

2. Start the application and access the **/manifest** endpoint. It should show the dependencies state.

### Installing on ASP.NET Core
1. Install the NuGet package

```powershell
    Install-Package NAME.AspNetCore
```

2. Add the NAME middleware in the *Configure* method of your *Startup.cs* file.
```csharp
// NAME middleware should be registered first so that the custom
// header is set before any other middleware has a chance to 
// send a response.
app.UseNAME(config =>
{
    Assembly a = typeof(Startup).GetTypeInfo().Assembly;
    config.APIName = a.GetName().Name;
    config.APIVersion = a.GetName().Version.ToString();
    // Comment the next line if you don't use the default Asp.Net Core IConfiguration interface.
    config.Configuration = Configuration;
});
```

3. Create the `dependencies.json` file at the root of the project, the following example is a good starting point.
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nosinovacao/name-sdk/schema-v1/name.dependencies.v1.jschema",
  "infrastructure_dependencies": [
    {
      "os_name": "debian",
      "type": "OperatingSystem",
      "min_version": "8",
      "max_version": "*"
    }
  ],
  "service_dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "Internal Service",
      "min_version": "1.2.53",
      "max_version": "1.8",
      "connection_string": {
        "locator": "IConfiguration",
        "key": "ConnectionStrings:InternalServiceUri"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

4. Start the application and access the **/manifest** endpoint. It should show the dependencies state.

### Non-Web Applications
For applications without a web server we created a SelfHost solution.
You can read how to install NAME on those applications at [Using NAME On Non Web Applications](https://github.com/nosinovacao/name-sdk/wiki/Using-NAME-On-Non-Web-Applications).

## Documentation
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/nosinovacao/name-sdk/wiki) for full documentation, examples, operational details and other information.

## Building and testing
We define our build using [Cake](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/), this allows us to define a common ground for developers on different operating systems, but it requires .Net 4.5 or Mono 4.2.3, so make sure you have those dependencies setup.

Bootstrap scripts are provided for both Windows and Linux environments. Keep in mind that not all tests will run on Linux, because some projects are targeting .NET 4.5+.

To build and run unit tests on Windows execute the command:
    
    powershell ./build.ps1

To build and run unit tests on Linux execute the command:

    ./build.sh
